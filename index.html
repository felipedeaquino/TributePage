  <h2>Inside of Emptiness</h2>
  
  <p class="content paragraph">Inside of Emptiness is the sixth studio album by John Frusciante, released on October 26, 2004 on Record Collection, and is the fourth in a series of six releases, issued from June 2004 to February 2005. The album features contributions from Josh Klinghoffer and Omar Rodríguez-López. Frusciante <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604184714/http://invisible-movement.net/articles/2005-press/01-jane">notes</a>, "It's really powerful, but in a gentle way. There's a soothing quality. It has hard things on it, and even the soft things have a heaviness to them. The song "Scratches" is emotionally heavy to me, even though it's not distorted guitars and bashing drums. There's another song about a couple's baby dying. There's a lot of spontaneity and recklessness and not giving a fuck." The vinyl edition of the record saw a repressing from Record Collection on December 11, 2012. These reissued records are 180 gram and come with a download of choice between MP3 and WAV formats of the album.</p>

      <p><b class="titles">"What I Saw"</b><br>
      There's one room<br>
      There's one light<br>
      There's one night<br>
      In the fire<br>
      In the pain<br>
      In the wire<br>
      This from me<br>
      This one lie<br>
      That seems right<br>
      Time can't climb<br>
      It can't be<br>
      It can't see<br>
      I seem to be right, I fall down tonight<br>
      I go to hell to be what I sell<br>
      Failing again is such a welcome end<br>
      Can the end of today be more than tonight<br>
      Echoes of these far reaching sights<br>
      And the pain of knowing you, should have tried<br>
      Give me your hands, give me your hands<br>
      Give me your hands<br>
      And we'll never die<br>
      We'll never die<br>
      This love song<br>
      It sits wrong<br>
      It means jack<br>
      The time's right<br>
      To be wrong<br>
      All night long<br>
      I feel good<br>
      I feel so far away<br>
      This is mine<br>
      It could be anyday<br>
      I saw what I saw, I call up a man<br>
      Distance is what gets me right in<br>
      I have a hand in everyone losing their place<br>
      Oh, never must stop, it's stealing my heart<br>
      Moment's to squeeze begging on its knees<br>
      I know I'll never be right beyond tonight<br>
      So give me your hands<br>
      Give me your hands<br>
      And we'll never die<br>
      We'll never die<br>
      Give me your hands, give me your hands<br>
      Give me your hands<br>
      And we'll never die<br>
      We'll never die, oh</p>

      <p><b class="titles">"The World's Edge"</b><br>
        These are different lives<br>
        Being lived at the same time<br>
        Like holding on to a whole<br>
        Like holding on to a whole<br>
        The world's edge is closer<br>
        I'm gonna leap right off her<br>
        And that will be the end of me<br>
        And that will be the end of me<br>
        Intersecting lines<br>
        Falling way behind<br>
        I'm walking on a rope<br>
        I'm walking on a rope<br>
        I'm drifting from her<br>
        I've never been further<br>
        All I know is right<br>
        All I know is right<br>
        Dreams drift right past me<br>

      <p><b class="titles">"Inside a Break"</b><br>
        Inside a break there's only moments that hide<br>
        Every mistake is really worth a try<br>
        I know a way a lie can be refined<br>
        Hand me your cross and run for your life<br>
        Any good luck is a falling tree<br>
        I'm no one and no one is me<br>
        All day to call some kind of faceless guide<br>
        Some day you see is just today in a guise<br>
        Every pace you go would go without you<br>
        The busiest days there's really nothing to do<br>
        I go away to turn the dark to light<br>
        Don't look at me when you're wondering why<br>
        Hymns sound so good to him<br>
        Reflections occur within<br>
        Unwind so called holes<br>
        Language is false but it speaks to me<br>
        Places are gone when there's no one to see 'em<br>
        I got a pain that spans millions of lives<br>
        Going to where we'll five into the sky<br>
        Any old way is a new way to be<br>
        There's just no cause for beating anybody<br>
        All of us kids we like to climb and fall<br>
        Once within there's nothing better at all<br>
        Than nowhere<br>

      <p><b class="titles">"A Firm Kick"</b><br>
        A firm kick in the pants<br>
        This last chance to get things right<br>
        This was one time I closed an eye<br>
        Looked away from you<br>
        Look out for yourself tonight<br>
        Sometimes I have to get things right<br>
        I never meant what I said to you<br>
        To give up all the things that you love to do<br>
        I'd never guessed that you'd done me wrong<br>
        I'll never accept that dance and song<br>
        A little time to adjust<br>
        Would be just what we need<br>
        I've meant to tell you what I think that you think<br>
        When I cross your mind<br>
        Forgone<br>
        Stressed at the light<br>
        Whats wrong with being uptight<br>
        I never say what I intend to<br>
        But does it mean that much to you<br>
        I'd a close call with a glitch in time<br>
        Are you really that happy to be mine<br>
        No I'm not disguising<br>
        All that fighting<br>
        And dreams not come true<br>
        I will play some light from the sun<br>
        The world by my side<br>
        I will see down as a forlorn maiden in the sky<br>
        And I will play a song of thunder you may recognize<br>
        You make a never<br>
        Thats forever<br>
        Knowing what you deny<br>
        When I revisit the past its a blast<br>
        I've just gotta move on<br>
        I've just let down someone I relied on<br>
        And I dont see why<br>
        How did we pretty up that speech<br>
        M City talking through me<br>
        I've never done what I set out to do<br>
        Don't come to me 'cuz I'll run from you<br>
        Left out of life would I really care<br>
        Not a whole lot<br>
        There's nothing for me there<br>
        I'll never forget the limits that we set<br>
        Bacl when it was out moon<br>
        I never made a presence of living with good sence<br>
        It's really not my strong suit<br>

        I can't get through<br>

        Self I can't find<br>
        I can't get through<br>
        I can't get through<br>
        A paper and a pencil<br>
        Are the best friends I've got<br>
        I went to downtown L.A.<br>
        Got picked up by the cops<br>
        I didn't get what I wanted<br>
        But I didn't care a thought<br>
        I saw that life was kidding<br>
        Look on, Look on, Look On<br>
        Look on, Look on, Look On<br>
        I'm warning you<br>
        I skipped a life<br>
        To be here<br>
        I've got no right<br>
        I'm bad luck<br>
        I used to feel a lot<br>
        Things used to be alright<br>
        So much was going on<br>
        I'm empty now inside<br>
        When I thought life was terrible<br>
        Things were going fine<br>
        Vincent called as a set up<br>
        Look on [Repeat x21]<br>
        It's not right<br>
        I lost my fame<br>
        It's a cheap trick<br>
        I want to do it again<br>
        I've got no life<br>
        I've got no life<br>
        I am a separate entity<br>
        From the guy I was before<br>
        Here nobody wants me<br>
        I hoped for something more<br>
        I flip through empty pages<br>
        That I thought I wrote on<br>
        I can't tell what is dreaming<br>

        And now a minute is trapped<br>
        It fell into a crack<br>
        Eleven tries leading the way<br>
        And then foresight comes<br>
        I've lost my sense of it all<br>
        The feelings I can't resolve<br>
        Circumstances outside convention<br>
        And you know I tried<br>
        To be part of life<br>
        I found the rest of me<br>
        I was beaten on down<br>
        Emptiness set me free<br>
        I lived on a cloud<br>
        Walk through the storm<br>
        Was like a holiday<br>
        I happened to have been warned<br>
        Over and over again<br>

        Now I'd found did my losing<br>
        I was tough to find<br>
        Playing games with my mind<br>
        Up the drops that I climbed<br>
        In the abyss I was hurled into<br>
        By who I brought back into time<br>
        I found the rest of me<br>
        I was beaten down<br>
        Emptiness set me free<br>

        You know you're quite a character<br>
        It goes that I haven't got a care<br>
        When we float down the river<br>
        I wonder will I lose you<br>
        When we roam through a blizzard<br>
        We'll joke and have another cry<br>
        I hope I'm not the other guy<br>
        We'll never scale those heights again<br>
        We've lost our daughter<br>
        Let's plan to hide from all our friends<br>
        In silent waters<br>
        Be careful of what you are<br>
        What you see is just a small part<br>
        You must look for yourself in others<br>
        And all the places that you go<br>
        You see that they are part of you<br>
        I want to again be holding hands<br>
        With you underwater<br>
        And couldn't we get a second chance<br>
        To go back and start over<br>
        I was thinking before<br>
        That it was all my fault<br>
        We dropped the baton<br>
        Sunday waves and makes faces at us all the time<br>
        And I'm wondering what I call mine<br>
